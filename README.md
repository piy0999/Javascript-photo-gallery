This JavaScript code contains a website (works best with google chrome) which contains a set of images which can be viewed by clicking on the image. 
Also, there is a slideshow button which presents the slide show of all the images. 
Clicking the image opens an image viewer implemented through the photo gallery library which presents the image in a more systematic and semantic manner.

The file can be run directly by downloading all the files into one folder/directoy and clicking the html.
